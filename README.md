#Thorntail Teiid

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/teiid/teiid-thorntail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/teiid/teiid-thorntail)

This project contains the source code and examples for Teiid Runtime Engine based on Thorntail. Using these modules you can build a executable uber jar that is equivalent to having a single vdb based WildFly Server.

Thorntail based Teiid is ideal to be executed in Docker environments or Cloud environments like OpenShift. Checkout the `examples` folder for various examples you can start with.
